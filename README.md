# Ann Arbor Restaurant Recommender

## Description

Ann Arbor restaurant recommender is a query application which prompts the user for a query and searches Ann Arbor restaurant menu data for a best match. The application then returns a restaurant and a menu item suggestion

- What was your motivation? - When you have a craving for a certain food or beverage it can take time to find the place to go to best fill the craving. When searching on Google, the search items returned are often not what the user is looking for, as often review information is used in the query. Even when these reviews say, 'I wish this restaurant had more **vegetarian** items,' when you search for 'vegetarian restaurants,' it return the restaurant as a match. In order to find food a user is looking for, the relevant menus should be searched. That is the aim of our project.
- What did you learn? - Many tools, algorithms, and processes were implemented that were new to us were used to implement this project including sentence transformers, similarity metrics, pytorch tensors and evaluation data annotation.
